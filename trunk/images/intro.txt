Congratulations on installing Anywhere Board Games!

Game pieces can be moved by clicking and dragging.  By clicking on pieces or the background, you will bring up a pop-up menu.  You can multi-select pieces by clicking and dragging on the background, which brings up a menu for stacking and sorting.

This comes with a number of pre-made boards and pieces.  Please click on the background and select "Load Board..." to access them. To add a piece, click on the background, select "Add piece...", and provide the URL for any image on the Internet.

To finish installation, you will need to make sure that the directory and the contents of the server/data directory is writable by your web server.

Have fun, and don't forget to try it on your iPad or Android!
