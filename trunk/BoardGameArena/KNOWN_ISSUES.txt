Significant Issues
 - There is no check keeping PieceImages that are still associated
 with pieces from being deleted.
 - There is no check keeping Pieces that are still associated with
 OnBoardPieces from being deleted.
 - We have to make sure that when a GamePieceControl is deleted that the
 entry is removed from OnBoardPeices and vice-versa
 - If a mouse is removed, or switching between multi-mouse states, pieces
   that are currently grabbed could get stuck that way
 - Instead of using keys, we're using gobs of references (i.e. GamePieceControl has
 a Piece, Pieces have arrays of PieceImages, etc.)
 - We should use notifications to get the board in sync with the World.on_board_pieces

Major Assumptions
 - Items in the Image Library are not modified, but instead are
 replaced through a delete and an add (which currently breaks
 PieceImage associations)
 - Items in the Piece Library are not modified, but instead are
 replaced through a delete and an add (which currently breaks
 OnBoardPieces associations).

Enhancements
 - Piece edit
 
TODO
 - Allow LoadWorld to append to the existing world instead of replacing
 - Search in image select and piece select
